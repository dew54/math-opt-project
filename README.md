# ISOLATED COMMUNITY EVACUATION PROBLEM
Progetto esame mathematical optimisation

This is python implementation of the Isolated Community Evacuation Problem (ICEP, see The-ICEP-Mixed-Integer-Programming.pdf).

The problem is split in two parts: <br>
       Deterministic one: see script.ipynb <br>
       Stochastic one: stochasticScript.ipynb <br>

See runExpe.py and runExpeStoc.py for implementation.
